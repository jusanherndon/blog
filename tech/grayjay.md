# Concept behind Grayjay

Here is a link to their [website](https://grayjay.app/). The reason this app exists is to have a shared platform between evyer type of social media. The video sites like Youtube and Twitch. Some picture based like Patreon. ANd many more in the works. Without breaking the current account structure of those websites. So to access Paid content like YouTube Membership streams and Patreon paid posts you still need accounts.

# Plugins

The grayjay team does this through [plugins](https://gitlab.futo.org/groups/videostreaming/plugins). Every website has their own unique plugin to handle any site specific issues. It also allows for bugfixes to be shared or even community members to start making plugins and then added to the official repos.

# Monetization

Grayjay is [open source](https://gitlab.futo.org/videostreaming), but they monitize through buying a licenses to the app.

# Desktop and Mobile app

They also have a [Desktop](https://grayjay.app/desktop/) and [Mobile app](https://grayjay.app/#download) so you can have a shared experience between platforms.

# My opinion

I really like the FUTO organization and would like to support them in anyway that I can. They are trying to create open source solutions to many things that were previously owned by corporations. And bring back power to developers and customers through their solutions to these problems.
