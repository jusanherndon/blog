# Difficulties with switching from my previous Carrier

Before I started using this carrier, I was using a previous carrier with an existing phone number I had from when I was a teenager. I wanted to keep my phone number, because I like it. Phreeli has really good [documenation](https://www.phreeli.com/number-transfer) explaining the phone transfer process. Like I think it is useful when transferring a phone number to any carrier.

*Sidenote: their are limits to when you can transfer phone numbers due to FCC* [guidelines](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/porting-keeping-your-phone-number-when-you-change-providers)*. One major thing to consider is that if you move geographical regions, phone number porting between carriers may not be possible, since all phone numbers are area based with the area code and the phone number afterwards.*

I have had a lot of issues through this process, but Phreeli support has been super helpful. They responded to me in a few hours after my initial email. Made sure my phone number was actually in their service database. Pointed out to me that it was not and I then started calling my previous carrier to get them to actually port over my number. When my previous carrier did finally decide to start the process, it was at 3 and 5 AM. When I was sleeping, but after the Transfer Number PIN I requested was expired. So I had to call that carrier back again to try and start the porting process again.

My previous carrier still has not ported my phone number, so I did some google searching and found the [FCC Customer Complaints Form](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us?return_to=%2Fhc%2Frequests). So maybe this will help me transfer my phone number in between carriers.

The FCC got back with me within a day and said they served my complaint to the carrier. I just got another temporary number transfer PIN and I am waiting for my carrier's response about porting over my phone number.

# Takeaway

TLDR; I really appreciate Phreeli's documenation, support, and straight forward terms in their [FAQ](https://www.phreeli.com/faq), [Privacy Policy](https://www.phreeli.com/privacy/policy), [Terms of Service](https://www.phreeli.com/terms-of-service) and the [letter from the Founder](https://www.phreeli.com/privacy-letter).

I know that their are a lot of issues with Mobile Carriers, like legacy software and systems set up, [Dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) and many more than I can count.

But I believe that Phreeli is not trying to be one of them and are trying to help people navigate these treacherous waters.
