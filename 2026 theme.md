# Forward

I watched this [video](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE?si=eNY9NPl3N-MxvVUK) from CPG Grey and was inspired to make a yearly theme for 2026.

# Theme: Exploration

The theme I am choosing today is **Exploration**. For the current me's understanding, there is a lot that I do not know. I have a fledgling media streaming server in Jellyfin, but I do not know which audio codecs I want to use. (I have done a lot of exploring on the video codec side, but I do not know that much for audio, video containers, subtitles, etc.) I also want to continue learning Hiragana to try to learn Japanese. (Japanese has three different alphabet systems Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji). 

I am sure the exploration theme might change for me during the year and I am excited for it. Because then I get to explore my exploration theme ;)
