# Introduction

I used to hate coffee. When I was in the third grade, I had a cup of coffee and it tasted terrible at my Grandparent's house.

*Sidenote from Future Justin: My grandparent's would buy a 10 LB box of Folger's and keep it for years until they finished it. They kept it for so long becuase they wanted to buy coffee for as cheap as possible without wasting money and they did not realize coffee is a Cooked product that can go bad. They assumed coffee had no expiration date.* 

For many years I held onto that bad cup of coffe and I believed all coffee tasted like that stale cup of Folgers. I was completly wrong and my roomate in college taught me how even cheap coffee tastes pretty decent. He started me on this journey and I am very grateful to him.

# First Coffee Grinder and Setup

I bought a really cheap [grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EPRFKO) and bought some cheap coffee filters from a local Kroger in Starkville. These cups were all really bad, but I had fun trying to experience a new hobby and going to the local coffee shop, [Strangebrew](https://strangebrewcoffeehouse.myshopify.com/), and just having a nice cup with friends. I later encorporated a temperature controlled [kettle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TB23QKJ) to try and start controlling variables in my coffee.

# Journey in Cold Brew

I started buying grinds from Strangebrew and bought a [Cold Brew System](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006H0JVW) to try it out. I had heard it tasted rather tea like instead of the bitter messes I was used to making. The first few batches were equally as bad sadly, but I eventually started making some pretty good extracts. I also started adding about 50% water and 50% Cold Brew concentrate and made a pretty good cup of coffee. It was really nice and helped me get through some of the pains of my tech internship at the time. I'll make another post about it because the company Fractal networks [Reflector Article](https://reflector-online.com/29412/news/starkville-startup-fractal-networks-aims-to-protect-data-privacy/) and I learned how bad some corporate small environments could be.

# Using a V60 to brew coffee

I eventually bought a cheap handcrank grinder and a [Haribo V60](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-V60-Glass-Brewing-Kit/dp/B08WYQB4QC/ref=sr_1_34?sr=8-34) to try and make a more consistant setup. I kept this setup for a couple of years and during this time I grew to really enjoy drinking Black specialty coffee from [Old Town Coffee](https://www.oldetownecoffee.net/), [Kaffeeklatsch](https://www.kaffeeklatsch.com/), and [O.Henry's](https://www.ohenryscoffee.com/). I spent a lot more time just trying to learn more about coffee. What regions it comes from? How to improve my individual technique and what makes a 'good' coffee? What does a Sour cup or bitter cup mean from a cup? How could the smell of the coffee bed change my expectation of every cup? Coffee really has a lot that goes into it and I also bought this [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1784729868) from James Hoffman to have an offline copy of coffee stuffs.

# Latest Setup

I am actually quite happy with where I am right now. I want to put other hobbies over coffee and do not really want to improve my setup too much further for now. I did get a [Baratza Encore ESP Coffee Grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW272XCV) as a Christmas present and it is giving me a lot more room to experiement with coffee grind settings. My old handcrank had 15 where this grinder hads 50 :). I am going to continue trying different regions of coffee and find more specialty coffee shop to enjoy :).
